ðŸš€ Features
 Get real-time weather for any city

 Displays weather condition and temperature

 Clean and responsive design

 Built with Flask and WeatherAPI integration

 How It Works
The user lands on index.html, enters a location.

Flask receives the location, calls the WeatherAPI, and extracts:

City name

Temperature (in Â°C)

Weather condition

A weather emoji is assigned based on the condition.

The result is rendered on result.html.
